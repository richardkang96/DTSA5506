This repo contains the final project for my Data Mining Project course, part of University of Colorado Boulder's Master of Science in Data Science program, aimed to look at which statistics are the most correlated and/or create the most effect to the total amount of wins in Baseball (MLB).
There are two files in this repo; one is a PDF of the complete report and the other is a PPT of the project.
